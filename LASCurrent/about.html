<p>
    <strong>III. MEMBERSHIP</strong>

</p>
<p>
    <strong>Hazing Policy</strong>
</p>
<p>
    No form of hazing whatsoever is tolerated by the club. Hazing, as defined by the Marist College Division of Judicial Affairs, is "Any action, which
    endangers the mental, emotional, or physical health or safety of a student, or which destroys or removes public or private property, for the purpose of
    initiation, admission into, affiliation with, or as a condition for continued membership in an organization or team whose members are, or include, students
    at Marist." Failure to recognize this policy will result in disciplinary action.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Provisions for Resignations</strong>
</p>
<p>
    If an officer resigns from his/her post before election for the following year is held, the E-board with the leadership of its President and Advisor, must
    appoint a temporary officer who is within the E-board or dissolve responsibilities accordingly. The temporary officer, if appointed, will reside until an
    emergency election takes place.
</p>
<p>
    **Please note that emergency elections are conducted only if the E-board balance of responsibilities is severely affected.
</p>
<p>
    Those officials appointed during emergency elections must re-run once standard elections for the following year are held.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>IV. OFFICERS</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The club has seven different positions: President, Vice President, Mosaic Editor-in-Chief (s), Treasurer, Webmaster/Head of Promotions, Secretary, and
    FoxForum Editor-in-Chief (s).
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Duties</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>President</strong>
    : This officer chairs E-board meetings and is primarily responsible for attending all SGA meetings. The President must also be present at most if not all
    general meetings held for the club and coordinate all activities. The President must be informed on all aspects of the club and facilitate a healthy
    collaboration amongst E-board members and interested outside groups. This officer must draft a club calendar, club budget for their term, and facilitate
    any revisions of the club BY-LAWS if necessary.
</p>

    club events. This officer will be in charge of organizing the club's community service activities and of ensuring that the Literary Arts Society plays a
    role in the community at least once a semester. The Vice President will also be in charge of overseeing the FoxForum prior to its publication.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Mosaic Editor-in Chief (s):</strong>
    Because of the extensive nature of this position, it can, and when possible should be, shared between two people. The officers are responsible for the
    organization of the club's literary magazine and its artistic development. The Editors are to assure that no material printed in the magazine is offensive
    to persons based on color, religion or sexual preference. These officers must report progress during E-board meetings and monitor budget allowances for the
    magazine's publishing. The Editors have creative control but they must still report to President before sending each issue out for publication.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>FoxForum Editor-in Chief(s)</strong>
    : This position, too, can be shared between two people. The editors will be responsible for gathering academic papers from a wide range of students to
    include in each issue of the FoxFurum. They will also have to assemble said papers into a readable document and proofread for grammatical errors. Although
    they will have a fair amount of freedom in terms of what should go into each issue, they are obliged to report to the Vice President before publication.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Treasurer:</strong>
    This officer is responsible for all dealings with the club's budget. They must inform E-board members of the status of the budget, hand in check requests,
    purchase orders, and Sodexho catering forms. The Treasurer is responsible for calculating monetary needs in reference to event needs. This officer must
    also keep a steady record of funding usages.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Webmaster/ Head of Promotions:</strong>
    This officer is responsible for the upkeep of club's website. The officer will help organize or document any events that will enhance the website, i.e.
    E-board member pictures, collection of calendar of events for updates, etc. This officer is also responsible for the club's promotion team. He or she will
    be in charge of creating and of distributing flyers/posters/etc. to advertise the club's events.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Secretary:</strong>
    This officer is responsible for sending general messages for all club members via e-mail. He or she reserves rooms for all events and meetings and keeps a
    record of all meetings as to update advisors or any officer or member who is absent. This person keeps club organized and in contact with one another. The
    secretary will be in charge of keeping a thorough record of the club's attendance and of organizing the club's priority points at the end of each semester.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Election Procedures</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Standard elections are held in the Spring semester each academic year. If a particular position is not elected then it is either appointed or
    responsibilities dissolved amongst remaining members until deemed inefficient.
</p>
<p>
    All members present at an election will have an equal secret vote. If a tie occurs, the President has the deciding vote.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>V. MEETINGS</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The club will hold general meetings every other week where attendance is documented and counted towards priority points. Alternate weeks, there will be
    workshop meetings where attendance is not mandatory. E-board meetings will be held once every two weeks, or as deemed necessary.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>VI. COMMITTEES</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Presently to encourage overall club participation there are four re-occurring committees. Those are: Promotions, Mosaic, Fox Forum, Set-up/Clean-up.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Promotions</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This committee's goal is to post announcements through College Activities about club events and increase the participation of students both within and
    outside the club. In order to disseminate information about the club's event they might utilize the radio, newspaper, or any other applicable form of
    promotion in accordance to school guidelines. The Webmaster/Head of Promotions will be in charge of overseeing said committee and making sure it is
    functional.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Mosaic</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This committee helps in all necessary aspects of the magazine and works with the Editor-in-Chief. This includes production, distribution, and editing and
    soliciting submissions.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>FoxForum</strong>
</p>
<p>
    This committee will be in charge of gathering information and collecting quirky details to add to the last page of the FoxForum publication. This page is
    comprised of facts/interviews/tips and other miscellaneous information that is reflective of overall student population of Marist College.
