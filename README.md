Marist's Literary Arts Society website 

Site can be viewed at https://delvecad.github.io/

This was designed when I was a sophomore acting as webmaster for the Marist Literary Arts Society, 
a club that workshops and publishes student writing both online and in print. I no longer maintain the site,
but this is the initial design that was used by the club.
