<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My first high school girlfriend, a red headed girl I met in the warmer months of my sophomore year, had a beautiful house on Flintlock Road. Pretty Romantically, it was there in her kitchen that I was threatened with a gun for the first and last time. &ldquo;My dad has a shotgun out back in the shed,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He wanted me to tell you.&rdquo; I thanked her for telling me, and I wished her father a happy birthday as I shut the front door behind me. I was wearing a party hat. He was wearing a scowl, and she was wearing my sweatshirt. I left without the hat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I always liked that house, with the pine trees that had branches like tire spokes that made them so easy to climb, and the wide front porch with white rocking chairs in front of green shutters, and her second story window that I would watch cars out of as they flashed by on the dark street. I don&rsquo;t have many fond memories of the girl, especially toward the colder months, but sometimes I still think about that place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We used to climb the pine trees at night and sit up there until it got too cold, or until the crickets got so loud we couldn&rsquo;t hear each other talk. The trees were sticky with sap and smelled like Christmas on summer nights, but we weren&rsquo;t climbing much by the end of the summer. That was years ago, so whatever pain I felt back then has blown pretty far away. But whenever I get a whiff of pine, it takes me right back. My memories of her are passive and indirect like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The only time I think about her is when something like a smell or song jumps my memory. I don&rsquo;t have any particular feelings for the girl anymore; we&rsquo;re both such different people after so long that I might&rsquo;ve known her from a book rather than life. But I like to imagine the house is still the same. I haven&rsquo;t seen it since I pulled out of her driveway for the last time on the last night of summer, but in my head it&rsquo;s still exactly the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Houses are easy to remember because they&rsquo;re consistent. Houses hold memories like scrapbooks hold pressed leaves. They stay untouched when you look back on them. I can still see every branch in the old pine trees, &nbsp;can smell their sap when I think hard enough. I can see the photographs on the wall of relatives I knew I&rsquo;d never meet, pictures I&rsquo;d look at instead of her. People, like falling autumn leaves, float and drift away. But houses can&rsquo;t leave. Houses can&rsquo;t change. Houses can&rsquo;t let you down. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">White pillars, oriental carpets, and a kitchen with marble counters complimented a girl who was just as pretty. But the house felt empty when we were together. Sometimes you can just feel it. You can feel the silence between songs you didn&rsquo;t agree on underneath the artificial lights that are just a little too bright. But these backdrops are what solidify memories in your head. I&rsquo;ll always remember falling out of love to The Sound of Silence in a house with &nbsp;pillars on the inside. How goofy is that? But it&rsquo;s that sort of thing that sticks with you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can&rsquo;t anticipate an emptiness when you meet somebody for the first time. You catch a flash of red hair and green eyes and it fills you with hope. But it&rsquo;s not their fault. You&rsquo;re the only person that can fill yourself with hope. But this girl, man, she&rsquo;d have you fooled on that. One look at her and &ndash; well &ndash; maybe she just made me feel an emptiness I hadn&rsquo;t noticed. She threatened to fill a hole I didn&rsquo;t know had opened, but there&rsquo;s a whole different kind of wound that opens up when you find out slowly and all at once that you&rsquo;ve been lonely in anticipated company. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then again, there&rsquo;s a very real kind of hole that nobody can fill if there&rsquo;s already a bullet in it. So I shut the door behind me, walking past a couple of rocking chairs and across a dark, pine-sweet lawn, and took a quick look back at the green shutters. The blinds were closed, but I knew what it looked like inside. I would always know now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&rsquo;m happy that her old man threatened me. I wanted to get some story, some anything out of the place, out of this girl, before we finally drifted apart. I wanted this First Girlfriend to mean more than watching The Graduate and not getting invited to an old Italian&rsquo;s birthday party, but I hadn&rsquo;t anticipated anything so Romantic as a gun getting waved in my face, sort of. In the end, I guess I did. I got a story. But even that feels empty. I pulled out of her driveway and drove away toward anywhere else, putting her house behind me. I don&rsquo;t think I wondered if I had disappointed her too. </span></p>
